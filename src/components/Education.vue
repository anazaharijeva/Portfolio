        <p> I am a 2nd year student... for this time spent studying I can say that I have gained a great deal of
          knowledge in the field of informatics. I enrolled in this faculty because I have always loved Web Develop and
          Web Design where you can be creative.During my studies, I learned how to do things the right way. Most of the
          time I was doing school projects and listening to subjects that would teach me skills I didn't know. I learned
          about design patterns, writing OOP code, project planning, database design, structured programming, scripting
          and markup languages. I don't have any work experiences because I'm still a student, but I can leave you a
          link from GitHub where you can see my projects made for the subject assignments in college</p>
